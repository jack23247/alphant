# AlphaNT Software Preservation Project
#### [AlphaNT Software Archive - Software for Windows NT on Alpha CPUs](https://mega.nz/#F!RyAxwAzQ!K1vjCrm7nd_lwNqlE-bU9Q)
A mirror for any kind of Windows NT for Alpha CPUs software available. 
This archive contains software found all around the network, mainly from those sites:
- http://vpsland.superglobalmegacorp.com
- ftp://ftp.hp.com
- https://winworldpc.com

If you have **any software** please open an issue and I'll find a way to get the files on the mirror.

### Listings
In the [listings](./tree) folder, an updated version of the tree will be posted.
